- screenshot_instructions.txt  (what screenshots to capture)

How to use:
1. Capture the screenshots as instructed and store them alongside these files.
2. Zip this folder and upload it as attachments in the LinkedIn App Review flow.
3. Paste the contents of request_text.txt into the Description field.
4. If requested, provide a demo account for verification.

- Placeholder images have been added under `screenshots/`:
	- `placeholder_step1.svg` — Authorization flow
	- `placeholder_step2.svg` — Invite flow
